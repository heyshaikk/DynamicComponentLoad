              When I think about web performance, the first thing that comes to my
            mind is how images are generally the last elements that appear on a
            page. Today, images can be a major issue when it comes to performance,
            which is unfortunate since the speed a website loads has a direct
            impact on users successfully doing what they came to the page to do
            (think conversation rates). Very recently, Rahul Nanwani wrote up an
            extensive guide on lazy loading images. I'd like to cover the same
            topic, but from a different approach: using data attributes,
            Intersection Observer and custom directives in Vue.js.
            <br /><br /><b>Step 1: Create the ImageItem component in Vue</b><br />
            Let's start by creating a component that will show an image (but with
            no lazy loading involved just yet). We'll call this file
            ImageItem.vue. In the component template, we'll use a figure tag that
            contains our image — the image tag itself will receive the src
            attribute that points to the source URL for the image file.
            <br /><br /><b
              >Step 2: Prevent the image from being loaded when the component is
              created</b
            ><br />
            It might sound a little funny that we want to prevent something from
            loading when we want to show it, but this is about loading it at the
            right time rather than blocking it indefinitely. To prevent the image
            from being loaded, we need to get rid of the src attribute from the
            img tag. But, we still need to store it somewhere so we can make use
            of it when we want it. A good place to keep that information is in a
            data- attribute. These allow us to store information on standard,
            semantic HTML elements. In fact, you may already be accustomed to
            using them as JavaScript selectors. With that, our image will not load
            because there is no source URL to pull from. That's a good start, but
            still not quite what we want. We want to load our image under specific
            conditions. We can request the image to load by replacing the src
            attribute with the image source URL kept in our data-url attribute.
            That’s the easy part. The real challenge is figuring out when to
            replace it with the actual source. Our goal is to pin the load to the
            user's screen location. So, when the user scrolls to a point where the
            image comes into view, that' s where it loads.
            <br />How can we detect if the image is in view or not? That's our
            next step. <b></b>
